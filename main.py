# Step 1: Design the system architecture

# The system architecture consists of the following components:

# * User interface: The user interface allows users to compose and send encrypted emails.

# * Key management system: The key management system stores public and private keys.

# * Encryption and decryption modules: The encryption and decryption modules encrypt and decrypt email messages and attachments.

# * Integration with email servers: The system integrates with email servers to send and receive encrypted emails.

# Step 2: Implement the user interface

# The user interface is implemented using a simple text-based interface. The user can compose an email message and specify the recipient's public key. The system will then encrypt the email message and send it to the recipient.

# Here is the code for the user interface:

def main():

# Get the recipient's public key.

recipient_email = input("Enter the recipient's email address: ")

recipient_public_key = get_public_key(recipient_email)

# Compose the email message.

message = input("Enter the email message: ")

# Encrypt the email message.

encrypted_message = encrypt_message(message, recipient_public_key)

# Send the encrypted email message.

send_email(encrypted_message, recipient_email)
def get_public_key(email_address):

    # Get the public key from the key store.

    with open("keys/public_keys.txt", "r") as f:

        public_keys = f.read().splitlines()

    # Find the public key for the specified email address.

    for public_key in public_keys:

        if email_address in public_key:

            return public_key

    # The public key was not found.

    print("The public key for the specified email address was not found.")

    sys.exit(1)

def get_private_key(email_address):

    # Get the private key from the key store.

    with open("keys/private_keys.txt", "r") as f:

        private_keys = f.read().splitlines()

    # Find the private key for the specified email address.

    for private_key in private_keys:

        if email_address in private_key:

            return private_key

    # The private key was not found.

    print("The private key for the specified email address was not found.")
