 A secure email encryption tool that uses public-key cryptography to encrypt email messages and attachments involves several steps. Here's an idea of how you can create such a tool:

Step 1: Design the system architecture

The first step is to design the system architecture. The system should be designed to securely handle encryption and decryption of email messages and attachments. The architecture should include the following components:

User interface for composing and sending encrypted emails

Key management system for managing public and private keys

Encryption and decryption modules

Integration with email servers

Step 2: Generate public and private keys

The second step is to generate public and private keys for each user. The public keys are used for encrypting messages and attachments, while the private keys are used for decrypting them. The keys should be generated using a secure random number generator.

Step 3: Store the keys securely

The public keys should be made available to anyone who wants to send an encrypted message, while the private keys should be stored securely on the user's device. Users must be advised to keep their private keys safe and secure.

Step 4: Encrypt email messages and attachments

When a user wants to send an encrypted email, the system should use the recipient's public key to encrypt the message and attachments. The message and attachments are then sent to the email server.

Step 5: Decrypt email messages and attachments

When a user receives an encrypted email, the system should use the user's private key to decrypt the message and attachments. The decrypted message and attachments are then displayed in the user interface.
